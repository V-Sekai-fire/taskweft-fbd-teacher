# The trusted data sources, derived from the ReBAC tuples in OpenBao KV
# `relationships/` (RFD 2200, verb `trusts`). Bao is authoritative; this file is
# the derived copy the writer and the publisher read, and the anti-entropy pass
# compares the two. It is read as an AST and pattern-matched, never evaluated.
#
# A code repository is not a data source: forks are tooling, and a placed fixture
# input whose bytes no published row carries is not listed here either.
