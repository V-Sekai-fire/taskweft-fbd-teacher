"""Publish a written stage to the Hub, the way publish_dress_on.py does.

The token is the `hf_token` field of this desk's `agents/<cn>` row in OpenBao, read
with a cert login that stores nothing. The upload is `upload_folder` with no delete
patterns, so a rerun adds shards. The README's `configs` block gives the viewer one
config per table with the joined view as the default; without it every directory
folds into one table. Nothing leaves until the stage passes the three refusals below.

# {hub.split("/")[-1]}

Intents and the IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagrams that carry them out, as an
EditScore-shaped corpus: one root row per intent, three candidates per row (rank1 the
reference diagram, rank3 one that compiles and does the wrong thing, rank5 one the
compiler refuses), and one score row per candidate from {scored}. Every row is
constructed from a template and a seed, so the labels are true by construction and
the corpus regenerates from the seeds. Controls were asserted on every row before
the emit.

Three splits. `train` trains. `test` is the same distribution with every tenth seed
held out: the gate after training. `evaluation` is whole held-out families and block
kinds ({", ".join(held) or "none"}), never trained or tuned on.

## What a row carries

Every artefact is in the parquet; nothing points outside it.

`{family}_root`, one row per intent: `key`, `intent`, `template_id`, `seed`,
`frame_id`, `blocks` (the block kinds and signatures the reference diagram uses),
`traces` (the input traces as JSON strings, empty where the family has none), and
the EditScore stub columns.

`{family}_candidates`, three per row: `candidate` and `rank`, `fbd_text` (the
compiler's text form, verbatim), `fbd_xml` (the PLCopen XML, verbatim),
`plan_json` and `result_json` (what the compiler planned and what the runner
returned, where the family has a runner), `fbd_sha` (sha256 of the text the
candidate was built from), `fbd_path` (where the writer kept it on disk) and
`provenance`. An artefact a family does not produce is an empty string, never a
null.

`{family}_scores`, three per row: `parses`, `compiles`, `runs`, `effect_matches`,
`steps`, `wall_ms`, `refusal`.

`{family}` is the joined view and the default config: the root row with its
candidates, each carrying its scores.

Rows: {manifest["rows"]} ({counts}).
Templates: {json.dumps(manifest["templates"])}. Compiler: taskweft-fbd-compiler
{manifest["compiler_sha"]}. Source: v-sekai-fabric/taskweft-fbd-teacher.
